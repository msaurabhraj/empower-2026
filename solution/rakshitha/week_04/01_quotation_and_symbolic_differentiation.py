GOAL / INTENT
-------------
Build the distinction between evaluating an expression and quoting it — treating it as inert data you can inspect, take apart, and rebuild — using symbolic differentiation as the concrete vehicle, since a differentiation program never "runs" the arithmetic it is handed, it only pattern-matches on the shape of an expression and produces a new expression as data.

TASK / IMPLEMENTATION
----------------------
An expression is one of: a number, a variable name (a string), a sum tuple ('+', addend, augend), or a product tuple ('*', multiplier, multiplicand). Implement every function below. Everything from derivative() onward must be built exclusively out of is_number, is_variable, is_same_variable, is_sum, make_sum, addend, augend, is_product, make_product, multiplier, and multiplicand — never by pattern-matching on a raw tuple's shape directly.

REAL-WORLD SEQUENCE TASK

A billing requirement document, written in plain English, says: "the total charge for a customer is the base fee plus the usage rate times the usage amount." Encode this requirement literally as a quoted expression — build it as data, do not evaluate it — over the variable names "base_fee", "usage_rate", and "usage_amount", then use derivative() to compute the marginal cost of usage, the derivative of that expression with respect to "usage_amount".

# Once you see marginal_cost_formula, it comes out to exactly "usage_rate" — but that is only correct if usage_rate is a true constant with respect to usage_amount, and the original prose requirement never actually said that; it is equally consistent with a tiered or graduated pricing scheme where usage_rate itself depends on how much has already been used. Evaluating the requirement literally, as a symbolic expression, is what exposes this ambiguity — the prose alone let it hide. Write 2-3 sentences identifying the follow-up question you would need to ask a stakeholder to resolve it.
# Need to confirm if usage_rate is fixed or varies based on usage tiers. If it is tiered pricing, we need the tier thresholds and corresponding rates before we can determine the correct marginal cost formula.
