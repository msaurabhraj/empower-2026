GOAL / INTENT
-------------
Build tagged data: attaching a small marker to a piece of data that says which representation it is in, so generic code can look at the tag and dispatch to the right representation-specific logic instead of every caller having to know, and check, which representation it happens to be holding. The concrete vehicle is AC circuit impedance, which real test equipment reports in two genuinely different but equally valid forms — rectangular (resistance and reactance) from a network analyzer, and polar (magnitude and phase angle) from an impedance bridge — with neither form being "more correct," just two representations of the same underlying complex number.

TASK / IMPLEMENTATION
----------------------
Implement every function below. Everything from real_part onward must go through the generic selectors defined for that purpose — never by checking a tag directly outside of attach_tag, type_tag, contents, real_part, imag_part, magnitude, or angle.

# WRITTEN ANSWER: where in the codebase would tagged data remove a pile of conditionals? Anywhere generic code currently has to ask "which format/vendor/version is this value in" before it can act on it — a payment module handling amounts that arrive as cents-as-int from one gateway and decimal-string from another, a config loader accepting both YAML-parsed dicts and environment-variable strings, a geometry module combining shapes described by vertices versus shapes described by a center and radius. Without tagging, every call site that touches the value repeats its own isinstance or format check and its own branch per variant; with tagged data, that check happens exactly once, inside a small set of generic selectors like the ones above, and every other function — including functions combining two values that arrived via different variants, like add_impedance — gets to stay completely representation-agnostic.
