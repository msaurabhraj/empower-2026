"""
GOAL / INTENT
-------------
Build two related skills: that "a set" is an interface — element_of_set, adjoin_set, union_set, intersection_set — that can be backed by different underlying representations, with the right choice depending on the access pattern you actually need rather than habit, and that a binary tree can itself be built from ordinary constructors and selectors, with Huffman encoding trees as a concrete worked example of choosing a representation specifically to exploit uneven frequencies in real data.

TASK / IMPLEMENTATION
----------------------
Sets of alert codes below are represented as sorted tuples rather than unordered lists or binary search trees: for a fixed-size, fairly small set of live alert codes on an embedded IoT gateway, checked for membership and deduplicated far more often than it is mutated, a sorted list gives near-logarithmic membership tests without the pointer bookkeeping a real tree representation would cost on constrained hardware, at the price of an O(n) adjoin_set where an unordered list would have made insertion O(1) — a trade worth making since membership and dedup are the hotter path here. Implement every function below. Everything from make_code_tree onward must be built exclusively out of make_leaf, is_leaf, symbol_leaf, weight_leaf, make_code_tree, left_branch, right_branch, symbols, and weight — never by indexing into a raw tuple directly.
