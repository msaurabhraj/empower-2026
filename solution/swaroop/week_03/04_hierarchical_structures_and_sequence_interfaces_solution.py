GOAL / INTENT
-------------
Re-express a nested-data task two ways: first as explicit recursion over the tree structure (the direct approach), then again as a chain of sequence operations (map / filter / reduce) — and see how much clearer the second version is once the traversal problem has been solved once.


TASK / IMPLEMENTATION
----------------------
Implement every function below. Do "Version A" (explicit recursion) first, then "Version B" (sequence operations), and keep both — do not delete Version A once Version B works.

You have a company org chart represented as a nested Tree of job titles (sub-lists represent departments, which can themselves contain sub-teams).
