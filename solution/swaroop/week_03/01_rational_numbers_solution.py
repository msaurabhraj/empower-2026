"""
GOAL / INTENT
-------------
Model a real domain entity — a rational number — as a data abstraction: a constructor, a set of selectors, and operations, all written so that nothing outside this file ever needs to know how a rational number is represented internally. If the internal representation changed tomorrow, only the constructor and selectors below would need to change.


TASK / IMPLEMENTATION
----------------------
Implement every function below. Do not access `_numerator` or `_denominator` directly anywhere except inside `make_rational`, `numerator`, and `denominator`. Every other function must be built exclusively out of those three.

REAL-WORLD SEQUENCE TASK
-------------------------
You are splitting a shared restaurant bill. Each person's share is expressed as a RationalNumber (a fraction of the total bill). Given a list of shares, compute the total fraction of the bill that has been claimed so far, and confirm whether the whole bill has been accounted for (i.e. the total equals 1/1).

Implement this using ONLY add_rational, equal_rational, and make_rational — never by reaching into RationalNumber's fields directly.
